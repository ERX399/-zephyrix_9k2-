不要再说写的烂了
就是这么烂爱咋地咋地吧

老有神秘人来薅我的源码,加个防护...

不是哥们,前端防护啊
防个普通人就得了,怎么还有专门过来压力我的?

Don't say it's badly written anymore, it's just that bad, so be it.

There are always mysterious people stealing my source code, adding protection...

Not a buddy, it's front-end protection, just to guard against ordinary people, why are there those specifically putting pressure on me?

Enough with the 'it's bad' already. It's garbage, deal with it.

Some randos keep trying to lift my source code. Gotta add some protection...

Seriously, it's just front-end protection to keep out the average Joe. Why are there people specifically coming at me?
